Models are based on abstract model class:
    constructor takes preprocessed data and options as arguments
    scale_model(scaler): scales data with scaler as argument
    train_model(): trains the model
    test_model(): returns various testing values, in the classes themselves can be chosen wich test methods are added

options classes:
    contain hyperparameters and data options for each model
    option class itself contains general values used for all models (e.g. random state)


Program can be run by changing the model and options in main or by running the file with the same name as the model
