Models are based on abstract model class:
    constructor takes preprocessed data and options as arguments
    scale_model(scaler): scales data with scaler as argument
    train_model(): trains the model
    test_model(): returns various testing values, in the classes themselves can be chosen wich test methods are added

options:
    contain hyperparameters and data options


Program can be run by changing the model and options in main or by running the file with the same name as the model
